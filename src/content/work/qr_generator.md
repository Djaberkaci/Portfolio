> QR-Generator

In this project, I developed a YouTube downloader application using the Python tkinter library and the pytube library for video downloads. The goal was to create a user-friendly and visually appealing interface for users to easily download YouTube videos while demonstrating my skills in GUI design, Python programming, and threading.

> Key Features:

##### Enhanced UI: 
The app boasts an improved user interface with a well-organized layout, clear labels, and aesthetically pleasing color scheme. I utilized the tkinter library to create an interactive and engaging design.

##### Threading:
To prevent the app's GUI from freezing during downloads, I employed the threading module to run the download process in the background. This ensures a seamless and uninterrupted user experience.

##### Status Updates: 
The app displays status updates, changing dynamically during various stages of the download process. The text color of the status updates changes based on the process's state, providing clear feedback to the user.
