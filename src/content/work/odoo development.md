> Odoo ERP Development

During my work at TAPIDOR, I have developed a variety of Odoo ERP modules based on the company's business requirements. Each project involved designing, customizing, and implementing modules that streamline operations, automate processes, and improve data management. My contributions cover the full development lifecycle, from initial analysis and conception to deployment and user support.

> Key Highlights:

##### End-to-End Development:
I handle the entire development process, including requirement gathering, module design, coding, testing, and deployment, ensuring each solution meets business needs.

##### Customization & Automation:
I customize Odoo modules and develop automated workflows to optimize business processes, reduce manual work, and enhance productivity.

##### Data Management & Reporting:
Implemented features for efficient data handling, reporting, and BI dashboards to provide actionable insights for management.
