> Low-Code Dev & MVP Builder

I build MVPs and web platforms using Bubble and other low-code tools. I help startups and businesses turn ideas into real products quickly and easily. My work covers everything from planning and design to deployment and user support.

> Key Highlights:

##### Rapid MVP Development:

I create fully functional MVPs fast, so clients can test their ideas and get real feedback without spending too much time or money.

##### Custom Platforms & E-Commerce:

I build platforms like marketplaces, booking systems, and online stores with payment integration and dashboards.

##### Automation & Integrations:

I connect apps with tools like Make.com, APIs, and workflows to save time and improve business processes.

##### Clean UI & UX:

I design modern, responsive, and easy-to-use interfaces for a great user experience.
